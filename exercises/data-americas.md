### Exercise: Reading and Inspecting Other Data

# Read the data in `gapminder_gdp_americas.csv`
# (which should be in the same directory as `gapminder_gdp_oceania.csv`)
# into a variable called `americas`
# and display its summary statistics.

# After reading the data for the Americas,
# use `help(americas.head)` and `help(americas.tail)`
# to find out what `DataFrame.head` and `DataFrame.tail` do.

# 1.  What method call will display the first three rows of this data?
# 2.  What method call will display the last three columns of this data?
#     (Hint: you may need to change your view of the data.)
