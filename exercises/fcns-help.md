# ## Exercise: Making Functions Work For You
# 
# Your task: take this input, round it to the hundredths place, 
# and save the output to a variable called `pop_for_report`

avg_population = 2.71563

# If you're not sure where to start, follow these steps: 
#
# 1. You'll need a function to do this. If you had to guess what the 
#    function was called, what would you guess? 
# 2. Use the help functions you know about to see if that function 
#    exists and how it works. 
# 3. Follow the instructions to produce the desired output.
