# ### Exercise: There Are Many Ways To Import Libraries!
#
# Match the following print statements with the appropriate library calls.
#
# Print commands:
#
# 1. `print("sin(pi/2) =", sin(pi/2))`
# 2. `print("sin(pi/2) =", m.sin(m.pi/2))`
# 3. `print("sin(pi/2) =", math.sin(math.pi/2))`
#
# Library calls:
#
# 1. `from math import sin, pi`
# 2. `import math`
# 3. `import math as m`
# 4. `from math import *`
